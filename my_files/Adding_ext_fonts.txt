1. Move the font files to the appropriate directory:

    Create a new directory called "fonts" under the "app/assets" directory in your Rails application.
    Move the font file "pacifico-regular.ttf" to the "app/assets/fonts" directory.

2. Configure the asset pipeline to serve font files:

    Open the "config/initializers/assets.rb" file in your Rails application.

    Add the following line to the file:

     Rails.application.config.assets.paths << Rails.root.join('app', 'assets', 'fonts')

3. Precompile the assets:

    Run the following command in your terminal:

        $ rails assets:precompile

4. Verify the font file is accessible:

    Open your browser and visit the URL corresponding to the font file, for example, "http://localhost:3000/assets/pacifico-regular.ttf".
    Ensure that the font file is accessible and doesn't result in a routing error.

5. Use the font in your CSS:

    Open your CSS file (e.g., "application.css" or "application.scss").

    Add the following CSS rule to apply the font to specific elements:

    @font-face {
      font-family: 'Pacifico';
      src: url('/assets/pacifico-regular.ttf') format('truetype');
      font-weight: normal;
      font-style: normal;
    }

    body {
      font-family: 'Pacifico', cursive;
    }

    Adjust the font-family and selector as per your requirements.

6. Save the changes to the CSS file.

7. Refresh your Ruby on Rails application in the browser to apply the font style.
